# SFML Text Button Utility Project
## By: <ins> Jose Gonzalez </ins>
The project has many different classes that utilize various different features for text input. It is a work in progress, 
however many different features have been implemented. The project is meant to be used as a utility for other projects. 
So far the project has an autocorrect feature, dropdown menu feature, text input feature, and the ability to undo text input.

- Currently working on the FileTree class. This class will allow for the user to navigate through a file system.
